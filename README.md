## About

A small Google Chrome extension adding keyboard navigation to [chess.com](https://www.chess.com/) website.

It supports moves input in:

- algebraic notation: 'Nf3', '0-0';
- coordinates notation: 'e2e4' ('e2 e4' and 'e2-e4' can be also used).

Other move formats may be implemented in future.
